\section{Description of Methods}
  For this project I implemented both the k2 search algorithm and the local
  search algorithm.
  The k2 algorithm starts with a ordering of the variables and then generates
  a Bayesian Network structure that maximizes the Bayesian score and such that
  the ordering is a topological sort of the nodes.
  The local search algorithm starts from a random structure and then takes
  local moves to maximize the Bayesian score.

  For my full search algorithm I used a combination of both of these algorithms.
  I first generated a random ordering of variables and then applied the k2 algorithm.
  I then used the local search on the result of the k2 search.
  This can only improve upon the result of the k2 algorithm and guarantees that
  I am at a local maximum.
  I also used a randomized restarting process to more fully search the space
  and to make sure the algorithm didn't get stuck at a poor local maximum.
